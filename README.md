Heart Disease Predictor

- Collaborated in a team of three to apply machine learning techniques to predict heart disease using the UCI clinical dataset, evaluating whether a fully connected neural network could outperform logistic regression
- Designed, implemented, and tuned machine learning models, including logistic regression and a PyTorch-based neural network, comparing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices
- Co-created and presented a research poster summarizing our methodology, comparative results, and insights, demonstrating that logistic regression outperformed the neural network on this small tabular medical dataset
